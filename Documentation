1. Introduction

The Fake News Detection System is designed to identify and classify textual content as either authentic or fake news using a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow. The model utilizes LSTM layers for sequential text analysis, aiming to achieve high precision in its classification.

2. Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud tensorflow scikit-learn gensim

3. Dataset
The system uses two datasets:

True.csv: Dataset containing authentic news articles.
Fake.csv: Dataset containing misinformation or fake news articles.
4. Data Exploration
Explore the datasets to understand their structure, examine null values, and visualize the distribution of news subjects using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. Text Processing
Perform text processing steps, including the extraction of publishers from the 'text' column, handling missing values, and combining title and text columns. Convert text to lowercase and create a target variable ('isFake').

6. Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of three key components:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
LSTM Layer: Processes sequential information in the text.
Dense Layer: Produces binary output for real (0) or fake (1) news classification.
7. Training
Split the data into training and validation sets. Train the model using the defined architecture and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

8. Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Optionally, experiment with model improvement strategies.

9. Model Improvement
Explore model improvement strategies, such as adding dropout regularization to the LSTM layer, to enhance performance.

10. File Structure

True.csv and Fake.csv: Datasets used for training and testing.
