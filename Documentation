1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The Fake News Detection System is designed to identify and classify textual content as either authentic or fake news using a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow. The model utilizes LSTM layers for sequential text analysis, aiming to achieve high precision in its classification.

2. Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud tensorflow scikit-learn gensim
3. Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
The system uses two datasets:

True.csv: Dataset containing authentic news articles.
Fake.csv: Dataset containing misinformation or fake news articles.
4. Data Exploration <a name="data-exploration"></a>
Explore the datasets to understand their structure, examine null values, and visualize the distribution of news subjects using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. Text Processing <a name="text-processing"></a>
Perform text processing steps, including the extraction of publishers from the 'text' column, handling missing values, and combining title and text columns. Convert text to lowercase and create a target variable ('isFake').

6. Model Architecture <a name="model-architecture"></a>
The model architecture consists of three key components:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
LSTM Layer: Processes sequential information in the text.
Dense Layer: Produces binary output for real (0) or fake (1) news classification.
7. Training <a name="training"></a>
Split the data into training and validation sets. Train the model using the defined architecture and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

8. Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Optionally, experiment with model improvement strategies.

9. Model Improvement <a name="model-improvement"></a>
Explore model improvement strategies, such as adding dropout regularization to the LSTM layer, to enhance performance.
