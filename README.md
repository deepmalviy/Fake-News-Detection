# Fake-News-Detection

Fake News Detection System
# Overview
This repository contains the code for a Fake News Detection System implemented in TensorFlow. The system utilizes deep learning techniques, including LSTM layers, to analyze textual content and classify information accuracy. The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between authentic news and misinformation.

#Key Features

TensorFlow-based implementation
Sequential text analysis using LSTM layers
Robust model validation for high precision
Classification of real and fake news

#Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, re, nltk, wordcloud, tensorflow, scikit-learn, gensim.

Import the necessary libraries and load the True and Fake news datasets.

Explore and preprocess the data, including text processing and combining relevant columns.

Build and train the deep learning model with the provided architecture.

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Optionally, experiment with model improvement strategies.
